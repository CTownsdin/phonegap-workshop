# phonegap-workshop  
  
Phonegap is a great piece of tech that allows you to build a webapp with standard HTML/CSS/JS and turn run it on cellphones just like a native app.  Supported OSs include Android, iOS, Blackberry, and Windows mobile.  

I build this phonegap app for fun one Saturday to try out the technology.  It works nicely :)
